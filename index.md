# Heath Reinhard's Portfolio

## Technical Writer | Editor

You might be my kind of company if you:

* Hire independent and kind leaders
* Believe that documentation is essential for all users
* Are remote-first and properly support distributed employees financially and technologically
* Compensate based on experience, not location
* Support ongoing learning
* Focus on creating real-world impact while also having fun and a sense of humor

## More About Me

Versatile writer and editor proficient at translating technical, historical, and scientific subject matter into various kinds of content; from articles, blogs and social media campaigns to technical documentation, marketing copy and reference materials. Adept at working with SMEs to explain their work in clear and concise English. I have written for audiences ranging from kindergarteners to teams of professional developers and engineers.

I have a passion for brevity and an obsession with eliminating superfluous commas wherever I find them.
