# Heath Reinhard's Portfolio

## Technical Writer | Editor

<!--
You might be my kind of company if you:

* Hire talented people and empower them to solve problems both collaboratively and autonomously
* Believe that documentation is a powerful tool for enabling engineering productivity and velocity at scale
* Are remote-first and properly support distributed employees financially and technologically
* Lean into using generative AI tools to augment documentation workflows
* Compensate based on experience, not location
* Support ongoing learning
* Focus on creating real-world impact while also having fun and a sense of humor

## More About Me

Versatile writer and editor proficient at translating technical, historical, and scientific subject matter into various kinds of content; from articles, blogs and social media campaigns to technical documentation, marketing copy and reference materials. Adept at working with SMEs to explain their work in clear and concise English. I have written for audiences ranging from kindergarteners to teams of professional developers and engineers.

I have a passion for brevity and an obsession with eliminating superfluous commas wherever I find them.
