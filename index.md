# Heath Reinhard's Portfolio

## Technical Writer | Documentation Engineer

Versatile writer and editor proficient at translating technical, historical, and scientific subject matter into various kinds of content; from articles, blogs and social media campaigns to technical documentation, marketing copy and reference materials. Adept at working with SMEs to explain their work in clear and concise English. I have written for audiences ranging from kindergarteners to teams of professional developers and engineers.

I have a passion for brevity and an obsession with eliminating superfluous commas wherever I find them.
