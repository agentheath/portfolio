## How to Schedule a Meeting Recording in Advance

This section is for users who want to schedule a meeting or event to be recorded and streamed _in advance_. Events can be scheduled using the _Meeting Recording Tool_ UI or directly from the calendar tool.

### Using the _Meeting Recording Tool_ UI

To schedule a recorded event using the _Meeting Recording Tool_ UI:

1. Access the _Meeting Recording Tool_ homepage.
1. Click the ```+``` icon in the upper left corner and select _Schedule a live_.
1. In the _Details_ pane, enter a title for your event and select a time.
1. In the _Event Type_ drop-down, select whether this event is a _meeting_ or a _training_.
    * Recordings of _meetings_ are retained for 60 days.
    * Recordings of _trainings_ are retained for 180 days.
1. In the _Video Conferencing_ pane, select whether you will be using **Workrooms** or **Zoom** for this event.
   * For either option, you can supply your own meeting link if this meeting has already been scheduled.
1. In the _Presenters and Audience_ pane your name will appear in the _Organizers_ field. Enter the names of other people who will be presenting at this event in the _Presenters_ field.
1. Toggle whether you would like to _Send calendar invitations_.
    * Invitations will be automatically sent to the _Presenters_ and all eligible members of the Workplace group where your event will be streamed (you will select this group in step 9).
1. Toggle whether you would like viewers to be able to join the call.
    * If toggled _off_, viewers will be able to watch your event in Workplace, but will not be able to join the Workrooms or Zoom call and participate in the event.
1. In the _Share To_ field, enter the name of the Workplace group where your event will be streamed.
    * All members of the group you specify will be able to watch the livestream of your event and the recording afterwards.
1. In the _Event Announcement_ pane, toggle whether you would like to make an announcement post to the Workplace group you specified above.
    * If toggled _on_, enter your post content in the _Description_ field. You can also upload a photo or image for your announcement post by clicking _Upload Event Photo_ below the _Description_ field.
    * See a preview of your post in the _Announcement Preview_ pane at the top of the page.
1. Click the blue _Schedule Event_ button at the bottom of the page to schedule this event and post your announcement to the specified Workplace group.

Congrats, you've scheduled your event! You will be taken back to the _Meeting Recording Tool_ homepage and your new event should appear in the left navigation under _Upcoming_. From this page you can:
* **Edit your event details or delete your event**: click the _three dots_ menu (...) in the upper right corner and select _Edit_ or _Delete_.
* **Join your meeting**
* **Access the Live Control UI to start and stop your stream**: click the _Live Stream Settings_ button in the _For Organizers_ panel.
* **Copy Workrooms or Zoom links for your event**
* **Copy the Workplace event link where your event can be viewed**

### Using the Calendar Tool

You can enable streaming and recording of meetings and events directly from the Calendar tool.

When you create an event in the Calendar tool, check the box for _Stream & Record_. You will be prompted to enter the name of a Workplace group. Your stream (during the meeting/event) and recording (after the meeting/event) can be viewed in this group and all group members will have access.

You must specify whether this event is a _Meeting_ or a _Training_.
* Recordings of _meetings_ are retained for 60 days.
* Recordings of _trainings_ are retained for 180 days.

15 minutes prior to the start of the event, the meeting creator will get a notification in Workchat with a link to the Live Control interface.

You can also access the Live Control interface directly from the Calendar entry for your event.

IMPORTANT: **Even if you scheduled it in the Calendar tool, your stream will not start automatically**. You will need to manually start and stop the stream from the Live Control interface due to _Company_ policy requirements.
