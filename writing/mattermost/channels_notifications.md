# Channels and Notification Setup

This section contains instructions for configuring Mattermost channels and notifications on both desktop and mobile.

## Desktop: How to join channels

Mattermost has different chat rooms called **channels**. You will automatically join the _ALL FYI_ channel the first time you log in. Say hi! This is a channel for all Mattermost users at _Company_.

To join other channels, click the **Find channel** search field in the left sidebar. A window pops up that allows you to search for channels by name. Ask your team which channels are important for you to join.

Mattermost has two types of channels: *Public* and *Private*. Anyone can join a public channel. To join a private channel, you need to be added by an existing member or admin of that channel.

## Desktop: How to create channels

1. To create a new channel, click the **+** icon above the **Find channel** search box and click **+ Create New Channel**.
2. A new channel dialog box will open. Give your channel a name, select whether it will be public or private, and write a description of the channel.

## Desktop: How to add members to your channel

1. Click the channel in the left sidebar.
2. Click the channel name at the top of the channel to open a drop-down menu
3. Click **Add Members** and search for people by their username or full name.

Any member of a channel can add new members, not just the channel admin. You can also add a user to a public channel by mentioning them with _@username_ in that channel.

## Desktop: How to configure notifications

1. Log in to Mattermost.
2. Click the gear icon in the top-right corner to go to your Settings. You can individually configure **Desktop Notifications**, **Email Notifications**, and **Mobile Push Notifications**.

## Mobile (iOS/Android): How to add yourself to channels

To add yourself to a channel, tap the hamburger icon in the upper-left corner of that channel. Or search for your team's channels in the **Find channel** search box. Ask your team what channels you should join!

## How to configure mobile app notifications

1. Tap the three vertical dots icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.
2. Tap **Settings**, then **Notifications**, then **Mobile** to configure your mobile notifications.
