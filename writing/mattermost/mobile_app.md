# Mobile App Setup

The Mattermost app is deployed through MDM and preinstalled on all iOS and Android devices.

* The app will auto install, even if it's manually removed.
* The app authenticates with Office365 credentials.
* The app will unlock with a device passcode, Face ID, or fingerprint. Once you've authenticated, you won't be prompted again for 14 days.

## Setup Instructions

1. The Mattermost app should be preinstalled on your mobile device. Tap the icon to launch the app.

2. The server URL should be pre-populated. If it is not, enter: **[server URL]()** and tap connect.

3. You will be prompted to login. Tap the **Office 365 button** to authenticate.
   NOTE: This step only applies to the case when you have not logged in to Office 365 in your mobile browser. If you have already logged in, the Office 365 authentication happens automatically and the browser redirects you back to Mattermost after the authentication is completed.

4. When you've authenticated, you should be automatically prompted to **Open this page in "Mattermost"**. If you are not, tap the link provided.

5. Tap **Open** and Mattermost should launch and display the *ALL FYI* channel. This is a public channel for all employees. Say hello!
