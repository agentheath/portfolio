# Mattermost User Guide

## Overview

Mattermost is an open-source, externally-hosted messaging platform modeled after Slack, both in terms of UI as
well as functionality. Mattermost offers a mature platform for self-hosting, resiliency in case of internal infrastructure failures or
outages, and a near-zero configuration setup with simple-to-use clients for web and mobile devices.

Since Mattermost is externally hosted and largely independent of our production technology and infrastructure, it's an
essential communications resource during outages. Users can communicate with each other privately or in easily-created
public or private group chats called *channels*.

### Who is Mattermost for?

Mattermost is available to all _Company_ employees. However, it is *essential* for oncalls, production engineers, incident managers, and others
involved in Incident Response. All _Company_ employees can use Mattermost as a fallback communications
platform in the event of infrastructure outages.
