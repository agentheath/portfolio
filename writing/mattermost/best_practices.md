# Best Practices

## Muting and unmuting a channel

By default, channel muting is turned off for all channels. To mute or unmute a channel, select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the channel menu, then choose **Mute Channel**.

Once a channel is muted:

* Email, desktop, and push notifications are disabled.

* A mute icon displays next to the channel name.

* The channel name appears at reduced opacity in the channel sidebar, and the channel isn’t marked as unread unless you’re mentioned directly.

To unmute the channel, select the channel name again to access the drop-down menu, then select Unmute Channel.

## Favoriting a channel

Favoriting channels is a great way to organize your channel sidebar. Favorite channels allow you to choose which Public channels, Private channels, and Direct Messages are most important to you.

To mark a channel as a favorite, open the channel and select the star icon next to the channel name.

This adds the channel to the Favorites list at the top of the left sidebar. To remove a channel from the Favorites list, select the star icon again.

## Notifications

If your feed is swamped with join notifications, you can suppress these notifications. Click the gear icon in the upper-right corner, select **Advanced**, and turn **Enable Join/Leave messages** off.

## Permissions and User Types

When it comes to permissions, there are two types of users: **Member** and **Channel Admins**.

### Members

This is the default role given to users when they join a team. Members have basic permissions.

### Channel Admins

This is a channel-based role that is assigned to the person who creates a channel. People with the Channel Admin role have the ability to:

* Assign the Channel Admin role to other members of the channel
* Remove the Channel Admin role from other holders of the Channel Admin role
* Remove members from the channel
