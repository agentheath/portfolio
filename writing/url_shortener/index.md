## Create a Short URL

There are several different ways to generate a short URL.

### Create a Short URL on the _URL Shortener_ Homepage

1. Go to the _URL Shortener_ homepage.
1. Enter the URL that you'd like to shorten in the **Full Url** field, then click **Create Shortened URL**. A URL will be generated with a randomized stringkey.
1. On the following screen, click **Copy to clipboard** to copy your new shortened URL.

### Create a Short URL with a Custom URL (stringkey)

This will create an URL in the format ```url-shortener.com/<custom stringkey>```. These are much easier to remember than randomized URLS.

1. Go to the _URL Shortener_ homepage.
1. Enter the URL that you'd like to shorten in the **Full Url** field.
1. Enter the custom stringkey you'd like for your URL in the **String Key** field.
1. Click **Create URL**. A URL will be generated with your custom stringkey.
1. On the following screen, click **Copy to clipboard** to copy your new custom URL.

### Create a Short URL with the Right-Click Menu

If you have the _Internal New Tab extension_ installed, you can quickly generate a shortened URL with the _right-click menu_.

1. _Right-click_ the link you want to shorten, select "Internal New Tab", and then select **Copy URL for the link**. This generates a new URL for the link you clicked on and copies it to your clipboard.

### Create a Short URL with the _URL Shortener_ Browser Extension

If you have the _URL Shortener_ browser extension installed, you can generate a URL for the current page you are on and copy it to your clipboard with one click.

1. Navigate to the page you wish to generate a URL for.
1. In the extensions section of your browser's address bar (upper-right corner), click the _link_ icon. This will generate a URL for the current page and copy it to your clipboard.

### Create a Short URL with a Keyboard Shortcut

For ultra-fast shortened URL creation, you can set a keyboard shortcut to generate a short URL and copy it to your clipboard. To do this you need to have the _URL Shortener_ browser extension installed.

1. In your Chrome address bar, enter ```chrome://extensions/shortcuts```.
1. Find the _URL Shortener_ extension on this page.
1. The field for _Activate the extension_ should say "_Not set_." Click the _pencil icon_ to edit the field. Enter the keyboard shortcut you'd like to use.
