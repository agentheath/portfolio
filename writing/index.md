# Writing Samples
## Tech Writing

> All identifying details and proprietary information have been changed or omitted in the following samples.

### Mattermost

Mattermost is an open-source communications/chat platform modeled after Slack. I wrote docs to aid the deployment at scale of an internally-hosted instance of Mattermost meant to serve as a back-up communications platform and remediation tool in case of an internal infrastructure outage.

### _Meeting Recording Tool_

_Meeting Recording Tool_ is an internal tool for recording and streaming VCs from Zoom and other platforms. The tool is used to record approximately 250 meetings/day, so accurate and effective docs were crucial for scaling its adoption.

### _Mobile App_ Governance Framework

_Mobile App_ is a fictionalized version of an internal company mobile app platform I worked on. Other internal company product teams could leverage the _Mobile App_ platform to quickly ship mobile versions of widely-used internal tools. In parnership with Product Managers, Product Designers, UX Researchers, Data Engineers, Software Engineers, and Management, I led the development of a Governance Framework to improve the consistency and quality of the constituent apps hosted on the platform.
