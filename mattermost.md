# Mattermost User Guide

## Overview

Mattermost is an open-source, externally-hosted messaging platform that is modeled after Slack, both in terms of looks as
well as functionality. Mattermost offers a mature platform for self-hosting, resiliency in case of infra failures or
outages, and a near-zero configuration setup with simple-to-use clients for web and mobile devices.

Since Mattermost is externally hosted on AWS and largely independent of our production technology and infra, it is an
essential communications resource during outages and SEVs. Users can communicate with each other privately or in easily-created
public or private group chats called *channels*.

### Who is Mattermost for?

It is available to all _Company_ employees! It is essential for oncalls, production engineers, incident managers, and others
involved in Incident Management and Response. All _Company_ employees can use Mattermost as a fallback communications
platform in the event of major infra failures or outages.

**Global Security Operations**: Mattermost is to be used in the event Safety Center is unavailable (an outage, etc).

IMPORTANT: Mattermost is **not** intended to replace Workplace Chat or email! It is a **backup** communications platform
intended primarily for engineers responding to the outage. During a major infrastructure failure or outage, Mattermost may
not be able to support all the users of workplace, which could result in system slowness and potentially interfere with the
engineers addressing the SEV.Therefore, if you are not directly involved in addressing the outage, we advise you to limit your
usage of Mattermost during the outage.
